a Smectic A Solvent</font></b>
<br>Prabal. K. Maiti, Y. Lansac, M. A. Glaser and N. A. Clark</center>

<p> Recent experiments\footnote
{R. Pratibha, N. V. Madhusudana, and B. K. Sadashiva,
 {\sl Science}, {\bf288}, 2184 (2000).}
 indicate that doping a very low concentration of
bent-core molecules in a smectic solvent can induce tilted and/or biaxial
 smectic phases. We have carried out Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a mixture of
rod-like molecules (spherocylinders) and bent-core
molecules (spherocylinder dimers)
 to verify the experimental results and to gain a deeper
 understanding at
a molecular level.
 Our MC results show
that when the end-to-end distance of the bent-core molecules is twice the
smectic layer-spacing,
a small concentration of bent-core molecules can induce anticlinic ordering in
an untilted smectic phase. However, when the end-to-end distance is equal
 to the layer
spacing we observe a nano-phase segregation,
in which bent-core molecules are concentrated
 in between
the smectic layers, depending on the concentration of bent-core
molecules and opening angle. We have carried out a series of simulations to study the e
ffect
 of opening angle, length and concentration of the bent-core molecules on the nature of
 tilted phase
and nano-phase segregation.
