<div style="text-align: justify;"> Jagriti Bal Vikas Samiti is an
organization working for children's education and welfare. It is running
schools for the underprivileged children and working towards their
social and economic development. It is also attempting to develop an
effective and meaningful academic and vocational curriculum,
educational materials and teaching kits for primary schools, training
the teachers, and establishing alternative employment resources with no
undue stress on academic excellence. Jagriti family consists of
volunteers and workers from IIT students and faculty, school teachers,
villagers, children, and full-time social workers. We are in close
collaboration with like minded groups like Prayas, Eklavya, ASHA, and
Association of India's Development (AID). <br>

it was born? </span><br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">During the late eighties Vivekananda
Samiti, a student wing of IIT Kanpur along with a few volunteers from
outside took up the challenge of educating the children of migrant
labourers on the campus. This activity led to a cooperative movement of
migrant labourers in 1991. A group consisting of IIT students, faculty,
and social workers continued to teach kids of the members of the
cooperative. Around 1994 some members of IIT community and social
workers felt the necessity of an independent forum to address the issue
of education and welfare of underprivileged children. Thus a journey
began. </div>
