Crystal</font></b>
<br>Y. Lansac, P. K. Maiti, M. A. Glaser and N. A. Clark</center>

<p>Recently there is growing interest on a new class of lyotropic liquid
crystals (LC), so called lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLC), due
to their diverse potential application in many areas, in particular in
biology. The LCLC family embraces a range of dyes, drugs, nucleic acids,
antibiotics and anti-cancer agents$^1$. They are fundamentally different
from the conventional amphiphilic systems: their molecules are plank-like
rather than rod-like; rigid rather than flexible, and aromatic rather than
aliphatic. They form isotropic, nematic and columnar phases but so far
there is no clear understanding between the molecular structure and the
supramolecular aggregates formed by the LCLC. We have developed a prototype
model of LCLC's which approximate the overall shape of the molecules and
the nature of the interactions. To understand the self-assembly of chromonic
molecules, we have carried out simulation in a binary mixture of our model
LCLC and water molecules. We have studied the effect of concentration,
temperature and molecular shape on the nature of the resulting mesophases.
We have computed different thermodynamical and structural quantities in
order to compare with the available relevant experimental results and to
probe the influence of a small set of parameters on the self-aggregation
phenomena in these complex systems.
